1.	What did you like about this website?

    I really like all the images and media on the site. The site is easy to navigate and well put together.

2.	Describe one significant difference between their own P1 site and this person's. E.g. 

- Which has a better user experience (and why)?

    I think visitors on their site will have a better user experience because of the quality of their media and the ease of navigation. I think mobile viewer may have a better user experience on my site because some of the content on the “About” and “Media” pages may be difficult to see on a small screen.

2.	Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?

    I think their codebase would be more maintainable because the CSS is very precise and not duplicated anywhere that I could see. 

3.	Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories? 
- if not, suggest some specific improvements

    Code and directories are very well structured.

4.	Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them. 

- were semantically appropriate elements selected

    Elements were appropriately selected. 

2.	is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?

    CSS is structured to minimize duplication. 

5.	Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?

    Awesome site. I think some minor changes to improve mobile user experience would make it even better.
